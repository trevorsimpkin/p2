## Details for teaching team
HTML validates, but css does not due to the use of Bootstrap. I used the word scraping method to create a comma delimited file of all of the paul noll web pages. My method for doing that is commented out in my logic.php file. 

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
* Bootstrap Theme: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/offcanvas/
